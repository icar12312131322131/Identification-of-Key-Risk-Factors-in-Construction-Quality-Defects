Identification of Key Risk Factors in Construction Quality Defects Using Unsupervised Deep Learning and Bayesian Networks

⚠️ Since the related paper is under review, none of the materials in this repository are permitted for reuse until this notice is removed.

Project Overview

This project leverages unsupervised deep learning and Bayesian networks to identify construction quality defects and their key risk factors. By integrating textual data, experimental parameters, and expert-coded information, the project enables structured representation of construction issues, causal relationship modeling, and risk visualization.

Key Features:

Identification of construction quality defect phenomena from textual data

Unsupervised semantic clustering to discover hidden problem patterns

Bayesian network modeling of key risk factor causality

Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to analyze problem hierarchy and reachability

Visualization of defect distribution and risk levels
